lpr (1:2003.09.23-3) unstable; urgency=low

 * By default, lpd will no longer listen to the TCP printer
   port by default. To change this, you must edit the 
   /etc/default/lpd file and remove the -s option.
   
   You only need lpd to listen over TCP port only if you
   need to accept connections from remote clients. Printing
   to remote print servers and local printing does not
   require this.
