lpr (1:2006.11.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added upstream patches
     + lpr.c [rev. 1.39] - portability patch s/0/SEEK_SET/ in lseek
  * /var/log/lp-{acct,errs} are now rotated weekly with lp:adm

  * Applied patch to fix -s option thanks to Joachim H. Kaiser
    (closes: #214445)
  * Fixed a bug in lpd/lpd.c where lines with whitespace in

    (closes: #142115)

    to lp.lp in the postinst.
